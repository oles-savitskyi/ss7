# Object Model

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft

---

# 1. Purpose

The Object Model defines the internal architectural structure of Domain Objects within the SS7 platform.

It establishes the common architectural composition shared by all object categories, independently of their business purpose or implementation technology.

The Object Model serves as the foundation for Runtime execution, persistence, querying and business behavior.

---

# 2. Design Goals

The Object Model is designed to provide:

- a unified representation of Domain Objects;
- explicit separation of architectural responsibilities;
- deterministic behavior;
- implementation independence;
- extensibility;
- compatibility across all object categories.

---

# 3. Architectural Principles

## Domain Objects are architectural compositions

A Domain Object is composed of multiple independent architectural components.

Each component has a single responsibility.

---

## Identity is independent from state

Object Identity uniquely identifies the object.

Object State represents mutable business information.

Identity never changes as a consequence of state modifications.

---

## Behavior is independent from storage

Business behavior belongs to Runtime Objects.

Persistence concerns belong to the Storage subsystem.

---

## Metadata defines object structure

Metadata specifies the structure and capabilities of Domain Objects.

Metadata does not define object instances.

---

## Runtime executes object behavior

Runtime Objects execute business behavior within a Runtime Context.

---

## Components collaborate through contracts

Object components interact through explicit architectural contracts.

Internal implementation details remain encapsulated.

---

# 4. Domain Object Model

Conceptually:

```
                  Domain Object

                         │

     ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐

     ▼                   ▼                   ▼

 Identity             Structure          Behavior

     │                   │                   │

     ▼                   ▼                   ▼

 State             Relationships      Runtime Services
```

Each component represents a separate architectural concern.

---

# 5. Object Identity

Every Domain Object possesses exactly one immutable Object Identity.

Object Identity:

- uniquely identifies the object;
- survives state modifications;
- remains stable throughout the object lifetime;
- is independent of persistence mechanisms.

---

# 6. Object Type

Every Domain Object is an instance of exactly one Metadata Object.

The Object Type defines:

- business category;
- available attributes;
- relationships;
- supported behavior.

Object Types are defined by Metadata.

---

# 7. Object State

Object State represents the mutable business information associated with a Runtime Object.

Object State contains:

- attribute values;
- calculated values;
- internal execution data;
- business state.

Object State changes during execution while Object Identity remains unchanged.

---

# 8. Object Behavior

Object Behavior defines the operations that may be performed by the Domain Object.

Behavior is executed by Runtime Objects.

Business behavior may consume:

- Runtime Context;
- Runtime Services;
- Metadata;
- Object State.

Behavior is independent of persistence mechanisms.

---

# 9. Object Relationships

Domain Objects may reference other Domain Objects.

Relationships are defined by Metadata.

Runtime realizes those relationships during execution.

Relationship management is independent of storage technology.

---

# 10. Object Components

Conceptually, a Domain Object consists of the following architectural components:

- Object Identity;
- Object Type;
- Object State;
- Object Behavior;
- Object Relationships.

Future platform versions may introduce additional components.

---

# 11. Object Composition

Object components are composed into a complete Domain Object during Runtime execution.

Conceptually:

```
Object Identity

        │

Object Type

        │

Object State

        │

Object Behavior

        │

Object Relationships

        ▼

     Domain Object
```

The composition mechanism is implementation-independent.

---

# 12. Runtime Representation

During execution, a Domain Object exists as a Runtime Object.

The Runtime Object:

- owns Object State;
- executes Object Behavior;
- participates in Runtime Contexts;
- consumes Runtime Services.

The Runtime Object does not own Metadata.

---

# 13. Persistent Representation

For persistence, the Storage subsystem creates a Persistent Object representing the business state of the Domain Object.

Persistent Objects are optimized for storage and durability rather than execution.

---

# 14. Architectural Boundaries

The Object Model separates:

- Metadata definition;
- Runtime execution;
- Object identity;
- Object state;
- Business behavior;
- Persistent representation.

Each concern belongs to a single architectural component.

---

# 15. Extensibility

The Object Model supports the introduction of new object categories without modifying the architectural foundation.

Examples include:

- Catalog Objects;
- Document Objects;
- Register Objects;
- Constant Objects;
- Enumeration Objects;
- Processing Objects;
- Report Objects.

All object categories share the same architectural composition.

---

# 16. Relationship to Other Subsystems

The Object Model forms the architectural bridge between Metadata and Runtime while providing the conceptual foundation for Storage, Query Engine, Transactions, Events and User Interface.

Conceptually:

```
Metadata

      │

      ▼

Object Model

 ┌────┼────┐

 ▼    ▼    ▼

Runtime Storage Query

      │

      ▼

Transactions

      │

      ▼

UI
```

---

# Appendix A. Domain Object Architecture

```
Metadata Object

        │

     defines

        ▼

Domain Object

        │

 instantiated as

        ▼

Runtime Object

        │

  owns

        ▼

Object State

        │

 mapped to

        ▼

Persistent Object
```

Each representation fulfills a distinct architectural responsibility while preserving the identity of the same business entity.

---

# Appendix B. Component Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| Object Identity | Stable object identity |
| Object Type | Metadata-defined structure |
| Object State | Mutable business data |
| Object Behavior | Business operations |
| Object Relationships | Connections to other objects |

Together, these components define the complete architectural model of a Domain Object.
