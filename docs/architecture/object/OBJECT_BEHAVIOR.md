# Object Behavior

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft

---

# 1. Purpose

The Object Behavior architecture defines how Domain Objects perform business operations within the SS7 platform.

Object Behavior encapsulates business semantics while remaining independent of Runtime infrastructure, Storage mechanisms and implementation details.

Behavior operates on Business State through architectural contracts provided by the Runtime.

---

# 2. Design Goals

The Object Behavior architecture is designed to provide:

- encapsulation of business logic;
- deterministic business execution;
- clear separation between business semantics and infrastructure;
- implementation independence;
- compatibility with Runtime Services;
- extensibility for future business capabilities.

---

# 3. Architectural Principles

## Behavior defines business semantics

Object Behavior represents the business meaning of a Domain Object.

Infrastructure concerns are outside the scope of Object Behavior.

---

## Behavior operates on Business State

Business operations transform Business State.

Behavior never directly manages Runtime State or Persistence State.

---

## Behavior is independent of Runtime

Object Behavior does not depend on Runtime implementation details.

Runtime provides the execution environment through architectural contracts.

---

## Behavior is deterministic

Given the same Business State and equivalent inputs, Object Behavior shall produce equivalent business results.

---

## Behavior does not own infrastructure

Object Behavior does not create Runtime Objects, manage persistence, control transactions or resolve references directly.

These responsibilities belong to dedicated architectural subsystems.

---

# 4. Architectural Model

Conceptually:

```
             Domain Object

       ┌─────────┴─────────┐

       ▼                   ▼

 Business State     Business Behavior

       ▲                   │

       └───────────┬───────┘

                   ▼

          Business State
```

Behavior transforms Business State while preserving Object Identity.

---

# 5. Business Behavior

Business Behavior defines the valid operations that may be performed on a Domain Object.

Examples include:

- validation;
- calculation;
- status transitions;
- business rule enforcement;
- business decision making.

Behavior reflects business requirements rather than technical implementation.

---

# 6. Behavior Execution

Object Behavior executes within a Runtime Object.

The Runtime provides:

- Object Context;
- Runtime Services;
- execution environment.

Behavior itself remains independent of Runtime implementation.

---

# 7. Relationship to Object State

Behavior operates exclusively on Business State.

Runtime State supports execution but is not part of the business model.

Persistence State represents storage information and is managed independently.

---

# 8. Relationship to Object Context

Object Behavior accesses Runtime capabilities only through the Object Context.

The Object Context exposes Runtime functionality using architectural Service Contracts.

Business logic remains independent of Runtime infrastructure.

---

# 9. Relationship to Object References

Behavior may navigate Object References through Runtime-managed Reference Resolution.

Behavior never resolves references directly.

Reference Resolution remains the responsibility of the Runtime.

---

# 10. Relationship to Transactions

Business Behavior may execute within an active transaction.

Transaction coordination belongs to the Transactions subsystem.

Behavior defines business intent rather than transaction management.

---

# 11. Relationship to Events

Business Behavior may produce business events describing changes to Business State.

Event publication belongs to the Runtime Event subsystem.

Behavior defines what happened, not how events are delivered.

---

# 12. Relationship to Runtime Services

Behavior consumes Runtime functionality through published Service Contracts.

Direct dependencies on Runtime implementations are prohibited.

Service availability is determined by the Object Context.

---

# 13. Relationship to Storage

Behavior is independent of persistence technology.

Business operations remain identical regardless of how Business State is stored.

Persistence responsibilities belong exclusively to the Storage subsystem.

---

# 14. Architectural Boundaries

The Object Behavior architecture separates:

- business semantics;
- Runtime infrastructure;
- persistence;
- transaction management;
- reference resolution;
- event delivery.

Each concern belongs to exactly one architectural subsystem.

---

# 15. Extensibility

Future platform versions may extend Business Behavior with additional business capabilities without changing the architectural principles.

Behavior remains independent of infrastructure evolution.

---

# 16. Relationship to Other Subsystems

Object Behavior remains the central representation of business semantics while collaborating with infrastructure exclusively through architectural contracts.

# Appendix B. Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| Business Behavior | Defines business operations |
| Business State | Stores mutable business information |
| Object Context | Provides Runtime contracts |
| Runtime Services | Provide infrastructure capabilities |
| Transactions | Coordinate state changes |
| Storage | Persist Business State |
| Events | Publish business changes |

Object Behavior encapsulates business semantics while remaining independent of infrastructure implementation.
