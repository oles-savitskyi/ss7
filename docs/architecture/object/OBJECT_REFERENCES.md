# Object References

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft

---

# 1. Purpose

The Object References architecture defines how Domain Objects establish architectural relationships within the SS7 platform.

Object References connect Domain Objects while preserving architectural independence between Metadata, Runtime and Storage.

Reference management is based on Object Identity rather than implementation-specific object instances.

---

# 2. Design Goals

The Object References architecture is designed to provide:

- explicit relationships between Domain Objects;
- implementation-independent references;
- deterministic reference resolution;
- Runtime-controlled navigation;
- compatibility with distributed execution;
- extensibility for future reference types.

---

# 3. Architectural Principles

## References connect identities

Object References connect the identities of Domain Objects.

References do not expose implementation-specific object representations.

---

## References are defined by Metadata

Metadata specifies which Object References may exist.

Metadata does not resolve references.

---

## Runtime resolves references

Reference Resolution is performed exclusively by the Runtime.

Domain Objects remain independent of reference implementation details.

---

## References are independent of persistence

Object References exist independently of storage technology.

Persistence mechanisms determine how references are stored but not how they behave.

---

## Navigation is explicit

Navigation between Domain Objects occurs through Runtime-managed Reference Navigation.

Direct implementation-specific object access is avoided.

---

## References are architectural contracts

Object References define architectural relationships rather than implementation mechanisms.

---

# 4. Architectural Model

Conceptually:

```
Source Domain Object

        │

        ▼

 Object Reference

        │

        ▼

 Target Object Identity

        │

        ▼

 Runtime Resolution

        │

        ▼

 Target Runtime Object
```

Each stage represents a separate architectural responsibility.

---

# 5. Reference Structure

An Object Reference conceptually consists of:

- Reference Source;
- Reference Target;
- Object Identity;
- Reference Cardinality;
- Reference Resolution Policy.

The internal implementation is architecture-independent.

---

# 6. Reference Resolution

Reference Resolution transforms an Object Reference into an accessible Runtime Object.

The Runtime determines:

- how the target is located;
- when the target is resolved;
- whether the target already exists;
- whether the target should be instantiated.

Reference Resolution is transparent to Domain Objects.

---

# 7. Reference Navigation

Reference Navigation provides controlled traversal between Domain Objects.

Navigation always occurs through Runtime-managed Object References.

Navigation behavior is independent of storage implementation.

---

# 8. Reference Cardinality

Object References may define different relationship cardinalities.

Examples include:

- one-to-one;
- one-to-many;
- many-to-one;
- many-to-many.

Cardinality is defined by Metadata.

---

# 9. Reference Integrity

Reference Integrity guarantees architectural consistency between related Domain Objects.

A valid Object Reference shall either:

- resolve successfully; or
- report a well-defined resolution failure.

Integrity requirements remain independent of persistence technology.

---

# 10. Reference Resolution Policies

The Runtime determines how references are resolved.

Possible policies include:

- immediate resolution;
- deferred resolution;
- lazy resolution.

Resolution policies are implementation details and do not affect the architectural model.

---

# 11. Relationship to Metadata

Metadata defines:

- reference declarations;
- reference constraints;
- cardinality;
- validation rules.

Metadata never resolves Object References.

---

# 12. Relationship to Runtime

The Runtime is responsible for:

- Reference Resolution;
- Reference Navigation;
- reference validation during execution;
- Runtime Object access.

The Runtime owns the operational behavior of Object References.

---

# 13. Relationship to Storage

Storage persists reference information without defining reference semantics.

Reference semantics belong exclusively to the Object Model and Runtime.

---

# 14. Architectural Boundaries

The Object References architecture separates:

- relationship definition;
- relationship identity;
- reference resolution;
- runtime navigation;
- persistent representation.

Each concern belongs to a dedicated architectural subsystem.

---

# 15. Extensibility

Future platform versions may introduce additional reference categories and resolution strategies without modifying the architectural model.

The architectural principles remain unchanged.

---

# 16. Relationship to Other Subsystems

Object References connect multiple architectural subsystems.

# Appendix B. Architectural Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| Object Reference | Defines an architectural relationship |
| Reference Source | Origin of the relationship |
| Reference Target | Destination of the relationship |
| Reference Resolution | Runtime transformation into an accessible Runtime Object |
| Reference Navigation | Runtime traversal between Domain Objects |
| Reference Integrity | Ensures architectural consistency |

Together, these responsibilities provide an implementation-independent mechanism for connecting Domain Objects throughout the SS7 platform.
