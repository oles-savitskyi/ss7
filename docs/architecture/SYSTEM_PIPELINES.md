# System Pipelines

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft

# 1. Purpose

System Pipelines describe the architectural flow of information through the SS7 platform.

Rather than focusing on individual subsystems, this document defines how architectural artifacts are created, transformed, published and consumed across subsystem boundaries.

The objective is to ensure that every major subsystem participates in a consistent model-driven execution pipeline.

---

# 2. Architectural Principles

## Pipelines transform architectural artifacts

Every pipeline transforms one published architectural artifact into another.

Pipelines never operate on incomplete or mutable subsystem definitions.

---

## Pipelines are deterministic

Identical inputs produce identical published artifacts.

Pipeline execution does not depend on implementation details.

---

## Pipelines separate preparation from execution

Preparation stages include:

- composition;
- compilation;
- validation;
- publication.

Execution begins only after publication.

---

## Pipelines consume published artifacts

Every pipeline consumes only published artifacts produced by previous pipelines.

No subsystem accesses another subsystem's internal construction process.

Each pipeline produces the published artifacts required by the next pipeline.

# 11. Execution Pipeline

Execution consumes previously published architectural artifacts.

Conceptually:

```
Published Metadata Graph
+
Published Runtime Service Graph
+
Published Runtime Context
+

+

↓

```

Execution never depends on mutable subsystem state.

---

# 12. Pipeline Composition

Pipelines are composed sequentially.

Conceptually:

```
Metadata
↓
Runtime
↓
Context
↓
Query
↓
Execution
```

Additional pipelines may be introduced without modifying existing pipeline contracts.

---

# 13. Failure Handling

If a pipeline fails:

- publication does not occur;
- downstream pipelines do not execute;
- previously published artifacts remain unchanged.

Partial publication is prohibited.

---

# 14. Extensibility

Future architectural pipelines may include:

- Workflow Pipeline;
- Reporting Pipeline;
- Integration Pipeline;
- Deployment Pipeline;
- Replication Pipeline.

Each pipeline should publish explicit architectural artifacts.

---

# 15. Relationship to Architectural Patterns

System Pipelines implement the architectural patterns defined in:

- Model-Driven Architecture;
- Published Model Principle;
- Compilation Pipeline;
- Composition Before Execution;
- Immutable Published State.

Every pipeline transforms one architectural model into another.

Published artifacts form the stable contracts between subsystem boundaries.

Execution consumes only published architectural artifacts.
