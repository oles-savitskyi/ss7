# Architecture Vision

AcCoreD (Accounting Core Development) is a metadata-driven accounting and business application platform.

The platform is designed to support:

* accounting systems;
* ERP systems;
* CRM systems;
* HRMS systems;
* inventory management systems;
* industry-specific business solutions.

The architecture prioritizes:

* metadata-driven configuration;
* extensibility;
* auditability;
* deterministic processing;
* storage independence;
* UI independence.

# # Platform Architecture Model

The AcCoreD platform consists of three major architectural domains:

```text
Transactional Core
        ↓
Business Facts
        ↓
Reporting Layer
        ↓
Datasets
        ↓
Integration Layer
        ↓
External Systems
```
Transactional Core is responsible for creating and maintaining business facts.

Reporting transforms business facts into analytical datasets.

Integration exposes platform capabilities and information to external environments.

# Architectural Layers

The AcCoreD platform is organized into the following architectural layers.

Metadata Layer
        ↓
Compilation Layer
        ↓
Runtime Layer
        ↓
Business Objects
        ↓
Posting Engine
        ↓
Register Engine
        ↓
Valuation Engine
        ↓
Reporting Engine
        ↓
Integration Layer
        ↓
External Systems

Each layer builds on services provided by lower layers.

# Core Architectural Subsystems

## 1. Metadata Architecture

Defines application structure using metadata.

Responsibilities:

* metadata model;
* metadata compilation;
* metadata validation;
* metadata references;
* metadata semantics.

---

## 2. Runtime Architecture

Provides execution infrastructure.

Responsibilities:

* lifecycle management;
* service management;
* dependency resolution;
* execution context;
* runtime services.

---

## 3. Object Architecture

Provides business object model.

Responsibilities:

* catalogs;
* documents;
* business objects;
* object lifecycle;
* object services.

---

## 4. Storage Architecture

Provides persistent data storage.

Responsibilities:

* storage model;
* document storage;
* register storage;
* totals storage;
* persistence infrastructure.

Storage Model:

```text id="ac23b5"
Hybrid Storage Model
```

Identity Model:

```text id="ac23b6"
ULID
```

---

## 5. Posting Architecture

Transforms business events into accounting facts.

Responsibilities:

* posting lifecycle;
* posting handlers;
* posting context;
* posting dependencies;
* movement generation.

Output:

```text id="ac23b7"
Register Movements
```

---

## 6. Register Architecture

Provides quantity and state accounting.

Responsibilities:

* information registers;
* accumulation registers;
* totals engine;
* register query model;
* register dependencies.

Core Artifacts:

```text id="ac23b8"
Register Movement

Register Totals
```

---

## 7. Valuation Architecture

Provides cost accounting and valuation processing.

Valuation Architecture is independent from quantity accounting while operating on the same economic objects.

Responsibilities:

* valuation layers;
* valuation methods;
* valuation adjustments;
* valuation allocations;
* cost movements;
* cost balances;
* valuation rebuild and recovery.

Core Principles:

```text id="ac23b9"
Quantity Is Independent From Cost

Cost Facts May Arrive After Quantity Facts

Cost Is Produced By Valuation Engine

Everything That Has Quantity Must Have Value
```

Core Artifacts:

```text id="ac23c0"
Valuation Layer

Valuation Consumption

Valuation Adjustment

Valuation Allocation

Cost Movement

Cost Balance
```

Processing Model:

```text id="ac23c1"
Valuation Engine
        ↓
Cost Movement

Cost Totals Engine
        ↓
Cost Balance
```

---

## 8. Reporting Architecture

Reporting Architecture is responsible for transforming business, register, and valuation information into analytical datasets and user-consumable representations.

The subsystem consists of:

Report Metadata Model
Data Source Model
Dataset Definition Model
Dimension & Measure Model
Report Execution Model
Report Runtime Model
Report Presentation Model

Reporting follows the platform-wide Metadata → Compilation → Runtime architecture.


### Reporting Principles
Reports are Metadata Objects.
Reports are Compiled Before Execution.
Report Execution Produces Datasets.
Dataset And Presentation Are Independent.
Reporting Reuses Platform Runtime Services.
Reporting Reuses Table Engine.
Reporting Reuses Expression Engine.
Presentation Is Renderer Independent.

## 9. Integration Architecture

Integration Architecture provides controlled interaction between AcCoreD and external environments.

The subsystem consists of:

Integration Architecture

Integration Model

API Architecture

Event Architecture

Import/Export Architecture

External Connectors

Integration follows the platform-wide Metadata → Compilation → Runtime architecture.

### Responsibilities

* integration contracts;
* integration services;
* API publication;
* event publication;
* import operations;
* export operations;
* connector management;
* external system integration.

### Core Principles

Contract-First Integration

Event-Aware Architecture

Integration Never Bypasses Runtime

File Formats Are Transport Mechanisms

Connectors Adapt External Systems
