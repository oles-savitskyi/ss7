# SS7 Engineering Principles

**Status:** Draft

**Version:** 0.1

**Language:** English

---

Software outlives individual technologies.

Programming languages evolve. Frameworks change. Databases are replaced. User interfaces are redesigned.

Sound engineering principles remain valuable throughout the lifetime of a platform.

SS7 is developed according to that belief.

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the engineering principles that guide the design, development, and evolution of SS7.

These principles apply to every architectural decision, platform component, configuration, and development activity within the project.

Whenever multiple technically correct solutions exist, these principles define how decisions shall be made.

This document is normative.

---

# 2. Engineering Philosophy

SS7 is developed according to the belief that long-term architectural quality is achieved through careful design rather than accidental evolution.

The project values clarity over complexity, reasoning over convention, and consistency over short-term convenience.

Engineering decisions shall be based on objective justification rather than familiarity or tradition.

---

# 3. Fundamental Principles

## 3.1 Justification Before Implementation

Every architectural component, platform capability, and user-visible feature shall have a clear justification.

No functionality shall exist solely because similar functionality exists in another system.

---

## 3.2 Study – Adopt – Improve – Innovate

SS7 continuously studies existing software systems and engineering practices.

When appropriate, proven ideas are adopted.

Whenever possible, adopted ideas are improved.

When existing solutions cannot adequately solve a problem, SS7 introduces new ideas.

Innovation is driven by necessity rather than novelty.

---

## 3.3 Platform and Configuration

The platform provides capabilities.

Configurations provide business behavior.

Business functionality belongs to configurations rather than to the platform itself.

---

## 3.4 Architectural Simplicity

The simplest architecture that correctly solves the problem is preferred.

Complexity shall never be introduced without measurable long-term benefit.

---

## 3.5 Long-Term Thinking

Engineering decisions shall be evaluated according to their long-term architectural consequences rather than their short-term implementation cost.

Temporary convenience shall never compromise architectural integrity.

---

## 3.6 Public Architecture

The Standard Configuration shall rely exclusively on public platform capabilities.

No hidden interfaces or privileged access shall exist.

If functionality is required by the Standard Configuration, it shall be available to every configuration.

---

## 3.7 Separation of Responsibilities

Each architectural concept shall have a single, clearly defined responsibility.

Platform capabilities, configurations, metadata, runtime, storage, and user interface shall remain conceptually independent.

---

## 3.8 Documentation Before Implementation

Normative specifications shall precede implementation.

Architecture is documented before it is implemented.

Major architectural decisions shall be recorded through Architecture Decision Records (ADR).

---

## 3.9 User-Centered Engineering

Technology exists to support business processes.

Users should focus on their work rather than on the software itself.

The platform should reduce unnecessary complexity rather than expose it.

---

## 3.10 Continuous Improvement

Every part of SS7 may be improved whenever a demonstrably better solution is identified.

Backward compatibility is important, but architectural quality has higher priority than preserving historical limitations.

---

# 4. Decision Framework

Engineering decisions should be evaluated using the following questions.

1. Does the solution solve a real problem?
2. Can the decision be logically justified?
3. Does it simplify the platform?
4. Does it preserve architectural consistency?
5. Does it improve long-term maintainability?
6. Does it benefit users?
7. Can it be clearly documented?
8. Would the same decision still be considered correct in ten years?

If any answer is negative, the decision shall be reconsidered.

---

# 5. Engineering Culture

SS7 encourages constructive technical discussion.

Engineering decisions are evaluated by their technical quality rather than by personal preference.

Alternative solutions are welcomed when they improve the platform.

Changing an earlier decision is considered a strength when supported by better reasoning.

Architectural quality is achieved through continuous review, not through inflexibility.

---

# 6. Engineering Goal

The goal of SS7 is not to reproduce existing software.

The goal is to create a platform that is simpler, more consistent, easier to understand, and more enjoyable to use than existing alternatives.

Every engineering decision should contribute toward that objective.

---

# 7. Final Principle

The success of SS7 is measured not by the amount of implemented functionality, but by the quality, consistency, and longevity of its architecture.
